Welcome to Huomautus's documentation!
=====================================

Huomautus (lit: notice, annotation, note) is an annotation processor for Kotlin-based
Fabric Minecraft mods. It contains helpers for mixins and auto-registration.

Huomautus does not include any dependency in your final code; it does not use any reflection;
all is achieved through the power of code generation.
